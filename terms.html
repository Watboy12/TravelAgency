                <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
                <p><strong>Last Updated: March 22, 2025</strong></p>

                <p>Welcome to ExploreWorld Vacation Agency ("we," "us," or "our"). By using our services or booking a vacation with us, you agree to these Terms and Conditions. Please read them carefully.</p>

                <h2>1. Booking and Reservations</h2>
                <p>- All bookings are subject to availability and confirmation by ExploreWorld Vacation Agency.</p>
                <p>- A booking is confirmed only after we receive your deposit or full payment and issue a confirmation email.</p>
                <p>- You must provide accurate personal information (e.g., name, contact details) during booking. We are not responsible for errors due to incorrect information.</p>

                <h2>2. Payments</h2>
                <p>- A deposit (amount specified at booking) is required to secure your reservation. The remaining balance must be paid by the due date provided in your booking confirmation.</p>
                <p>- Payments can be made via credit card, bank transfer, or other methods listed on our website.</p>
                <p>- Late payments may result in cancellation of your booking without refund of any deposits paid.</p>

                <h2>3. Pricing</h2>
                <p>- All prices are in USD unless otherwise stated and include only what is explicitly listed in the package details.</p>
                <p>- Prices are subject to change until your booking is confirmed. Additional fees (e.g., taxes, surcharges) may apply and will be communicated before confirmation.</p>

                <h2>4. Cancellations and Refunds</h2>
                <p>- <strong>By You</strong>: Cancellations must be submitted in writing (email to support@exploreworldvacations.com). Refund policies are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More than 60 days before departure: Full refund minus a $50 administrative fee.</li>
                    <li>30-60 days before departure: 50% refund of total cost.</li>
                    <li>Less than 30 days before departure: No refund.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>- <strong>By Us</strong>: We reserve the right to cancel a trip due to insufficient bookings, safety concerns, or unforeseen circumstances. If we cancel, you’ll receive a full refund or an alternative trip option, at our discretion.</p>

                <h2>5. Changes to Bookings</h2>
                <p>- Changes requested by you (e.g., dates, destinations) are subject to availability and may incur additional fees.</p>
                <p>- We may modify trip itineraries, accommodations, or services if necessary (e.g., due to weather, supplier issues). We’ll notify you of significant changes as soon as possible.</p>

                <h2>6. Travel Documents and Insurance</h2>
                <p>- You are responsible for obtaining valid passports, visas, and any required vaccinations. We are not liable for issues arising from missing or invalid documents.</p>
                <p>- Travel insurance is strongly recommended but not included unless specified. It’s your responsibility to secure coverage for cancellations, medical emergencies, or lost luggage.</p>

                <h2>7. Liability</h2>
                <p>- We act as an agent for third-party suppliers (e.g., airlines, hotels). We are not liable for their actions, delays, or failures.</p>
                <p>- ExploreWorld Vacation Agency is not responsible</p>
